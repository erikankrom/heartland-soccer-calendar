# Milestone v1.0: Launch

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-02-20
**Phases:** 1–2
**Total Plans:** 2

## Overview

Initial public launch of the Heartland Soccer Team Calendar tool. Adds field map links to both iCal events and the subscribe page, and introduces a landing page value section explaining the tool's benefits.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Field Map Links

**Goal:** Add a link to the field map on both the subscribe page (events preview) and in the body of the generated iCal calendar events. Uses the `field_map_url` column in `src/locations.csv`.
**Depends on:** —
**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:

- [x] 01-01: Plumb field_map_url through CSV, location resolution, iCal DESCRIPTION, and subscribe page event rows

**Details:**

`field_map_url` fourth column added to `src/locations.csv` for all 6 known Heartland Soccer venue prefixes (OSC, OP, CMSF, SSV, HSP, MAW). `parseLocationsCSV` reads the new column and stores it as `mapUrl` on each location entry. `resolveLocation()` propagates `mapUrl` through both return paths. iCal `DESCRIPTION` includes `\nField map: {url}` for known venues. Subscribe page event rows show a clickable "Field map" anchor for known venues only.

### Phase 2: Homepage Value Section

**Goal:** Add a brief "why this is useful" section to the landing page. Cover key features: subscribing to all games at once (vs adding individually), enhanced location naming, field map URLs, and native calendar location integration. Also include a "Planned Updates" section listing upcoming features.
**Depends on:** Phase 1
**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:

- [x] 02-01: Add value section (feature list) and planned-updates section to landing page

**Details:**

Two static HTML sections added to `renderLandingPage()` inside `.container` below the form card. `.value-section` uses CSS mask trick for accent-colored checkmark bullets. `.planned-section` uses border-only empty-circle bullets with dimmed text. Post-checkpoint copy edits: removed inaccurate "auto-updates every hour" bullet (refresh is client-controlled); corrected venue name example to "GARMIN Olathe Soccer Complex" / "OSC 7A".

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- Field map URL goes in iCal `DESCRIPTION` only — `URL:` property is already used for the Heartland Soccer source page; two `URL:` lines in a VEVENT is invalid RFC 5545
- Subscribe page uses existing `meta` class + global `a { color: var(--accent) }` — no extra CSS class needed
- `esc()` helper applied to `loc.mapUrl` in client-side JS to prevent XSS
- CSS mask approach for checkmark bullets — single CSS rule, no inline SVG per item, respects `--accent` in both light/dark mode automatically
- Removed "Calendar auto-updates every hour" copy — refresh interval is controlled by the subscribing calendar client, not the worker's cache TTL
- Venue name example changed to actual venue name "GARMIN Olathe Soccer Complex" from `src/locations.csv`

**Issues Resolved:**

- None

**Issues Deferred:**

- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- None
